SteamPress is a Swift blogging engine for use with the Vapor Framework to deploy blogs to sites that run on top of Vapor. It uses [Fluent](https://github.com/vapor/fluent) so will work with any database that has a Fluent Driver. It also incorporates a [Markdown Provider](https://github.com/vapor-community/markdown-provider) allowing you to write your posts in Markdown and then use Leaf to render the markdown.

The blog can either be used as the root of your website (i.e. appearing at https://www.acme.org) or in a subpath (i.e. https://www.acme.org/blog/).

There is an example of how it can work in a site (and what it requires in terms of Leaf templates and the parameters is passes to them) at https://github.com/brokenhandsio/SteamPressExample.

## Features:

* Blog entries with Markdown
* Multiple user accounts
* Tags on blog posts
* Snippet for posts
* Draft Posts
* Works with any Fluent driver
* Protected Admin route for creating blog posts
* Pagination on the main blog page
* Slug URLs for SEO optimisation and easy linking to posts
* Support for comments via Disqus
* Open Graph and Twitter Card support
* RSS/Atom Feed support
* Blog Search

# How to Use


## DOC UPDATES COMING SOON

**Note:** the `Production` environment will only work on HTTPS for security reasons.

## Integration

In order for SteamPress to work properly, it requires various Middleware to do things like authentication. You must add these to your `droplet.json` so they are loaded up and SteamPress can work properly. In your `droplet.json` add `steampress-sessions` and `blog-persist` like so (and in this order):

```json
{
    ...
    "middleware": [
        ...,
        "steampress-sessions"
        "blog-persist"
    ],
    ...
}
```

`steampress-sessions` will used the `Droplet`'s configured `SessionsProtocol` implementation and you can configure it in your `Configuration` (for example to use Redis instead of in-memory).

## Setup

SteamPress is easy to integrate with your application. First add SteamPress to your `Package.swift` dependencies:

```swift
dependencies: [
    ...,
    .package(url: "https://github.com/brokenhandsio/SteamPress", from: "0.16.0")
]
```

Next import it in the file where you are setting up your `Droplet` with:

```swift
import SteamPress
```

Finally, add the provider!

```swift
try config.addProvider(SteamPress.Provider.self)
```

This will look for a config file called `steampress.json` that looks like:

```json
{
    "postsPerPage": 5,
    "blogPath": "blog"
}
```

The `blogPath` line is optional, if you want your blog to be at the root path of your site, just remove that line.

**Note:** you should add the SteamPress Provider before you add the `FluentProvider` to ensure that the password for the admin account is logged out correctly.

### Manual initialisation

You can also initialise the Provider manually, by creating it as so:

```swift
let steampress = SteamPress.Provider(postsPerPage: 5)
config.addProvider(steampress)
```

This will initialise it as the root path of your site. If you wish to have it in a subdirectory, initialise it with:

```swift
let steampress = SteamPress.Provider(postsPerPage: 5, blogPath: "blog")
config.addProvider(steampress)
```

### Bootstrap Versions

By default, the paginator used by SteamPress is expecting to use Bootstrap 4. You can configure it to use Bootstrap 3 by either adding it to the configuration file or the manual initialisation. To add to a config file, in your `steampress.json`, add:

```json
{
    "postsPerPage": 5,
    "blogPath": "blog",
    "paginator": {
        "useBootstrap4": false
    }
}
```

To manually iniatialise, set up the Provider like so:

```swift
let steampress = SteamPress.Provider(postsPerPage: 5, blogPath: "blog", useBootstrap4: false)
```

### Disabling Routes

You can disable the routes for authors pages and tags pages (both individual and all) by adding the option in your configuration file. To disable all of the authors pages, in your `steampress.json` add:

```json
{
    "enableAuthorsPages": false
}
```

To disable all of the tags pages, set:

```json
{
    "enableTagsPages": false
}
```

Both of these settings can also be configured if manually setting up the Provider:

```swift
let steampress = SteamPress.Provider(postsPerPage:5, enableAuthorsPages: true, enableTagsPages: true)
```

## Logging In

When you first launch SteamPress a preparation runs that seeds the database with an admin user. The username is `admin` and the password will be printined out to your app's logs. You will be required to reset your password when you first login. It is recommended you do this as soon as your site is up and running.

## Comments

SteamPress currently supports using [Disqus](https://disqus.com) for the comments engine. To use Disqus, just add a config file `disqus.json` to your site that looks like:

```json
{
    "disqusName": "NAME_OF_YOUR_DISQUS_SITE"
}
```

(You can get the name of your Disqus site from your Disqus admin panel)

This will pass it through to the Leaf templates for the Blog index (`blog.leaf`), blog posts (`blogpost.leaf`), author page (`profile.leaf`) and tag page (`tag.leaf`) so you can include it if needs be. If you want to manually set up comments you can do this yourself and just include the necessary files for your provider. This is mainly to provide easy configuration for the [Platform site](https://github.com/brokenhandsio/SteamPressExample).

## Open Graph Twitter Card Support

SteamPress supports both Open Graph and Twitter Cards. The Blog Post `all` Context (see below) will pass in the created date and last edited date (if applicable) in ISO 8601 format for Open Graph article support, under the parameters `create_date_iso8601` and `last_edited_date_iso8601`.

The Blog Post page will also be passed a number of other useful parameters for Open Graph and Twitter Cards. See the `blogpost.leaf` section below.

The Twitter handle of the site can be configured with a `twitter.json` config file (or injected in) with a property `siteHandle` (the site's twitter handle without the `@`). If set, this will be injected into the public pages as described below. This is for the `twitter:site` tag for Twitter Cards

## Google Analytics Support

SteamPress makes it easy to integrate Google Analytics into your blog. If you create a `googleAnalytics.json` config file that looks like:

```json
{
    "identifier": "YOUR_IDENTIFIER"
}
```

(You can get your identifier from the Google Analytics console, it will look something like UA-12345678-1)

This will pass a `google_analytics_identifier` parameter through to all of the public pages which you can include and then use the [Example Site's javascript](https://github.com/brokenhandsio/SteamPressExample/blob/master/Public/static/js/analytics.js) to integrate with.

## Atom/RSS Support

SteamPress automatically provides endpoints for registering RSS readers, either using RSS 2.0 or Atom 1.0. These endpoints can be found at the blog's `atom.xml` and `rss.xml` paths; e.g. if you blog is at `https://www.example.com/blog` then the atom feed will appear at `https://wwww.example.com/blog/atom.xml`. These will work by default, but you will probably want to configure some of fields. These can be added to your `steampress.json` config file, with the following values:

* `title` - the title of the blog - a default "SteamPress Blog" will be provided otherwise
* `description` - the description of the blog (or subtitle in atom) - a default "SteamPress is an open-source blogging engine written for Vapor in Swift" will be provided otherwise
* `copyright` - an optional copyright message to add to the feeds
* `imageURL` - an optional image/logo to add to the feeds. Note that for Atom this should a 2:1 landscape scaled image

## Search Support

SteamPress has a built in blog search. It will register a route, `/search`, under your blog path which you can send a query through to, with a key of `term` to search the blog.


# Expected Leaf Templates

SteamPress expects there to be a number of Leaf template files in the correct location in `Resources/Views`. All these files should be in a `blog` directory, with the admin template files being in an `admin` directory. For an example of how it SteamPress works with the leaf templates, see the [Example SteamPress site](https://github.com/brokenhandsio/SteamPressExample).

For every Leaf template, a `user` parameter will be passed in for the currently logged in user, if there is a user currently logged in. This is useful for displaying a 'Create Post' link throughout the site when logged in etc.

The basic structure of your `Resources/View` directory should be:

* `blog`
  * `blog.leaf` - the main index page
  * `blogpost.leaf` - the page for a single blog post
  * `tag.leaf` - the page for a tag
  * `profile.leaf` - the page for a user profile
  * `tags.leaf` - the page for displaying all of the tags
  * `authors.leaf` - the page for displaying all of the authors
  * `search.leaf` - the page to display search results
  * `admin`
    * `createPost.leaf` - the page for creating and editing a blog post
    * `createUser.leaf` - the page for creating and editing a user
    * `index.leaf` - the index page for the Admin site
    * `login.leaf` - the login page for the Admin site
    * `resetPassword.leaf` - the page for resetting your password

## `POST` Routes

There are a number of `POST` routes to the Admin site for creating and editing user etc that are required otherwise you will receive errors.

This section needs to be filled out, but you can view the Controllers in the code to work out what they should be, or see the [Example Site](https://github.com/brokenhandsio/SteamPressExample).

# Contexts

## Blog Post

The blog post has a number of `Context`s you can pass to the `makeNode()` function to provide more information when getting a `BlogPost`. Currently there are three contexts supported:

* `.shortSnippet` - this will return the post with an `id`, `title`, `author_name`, `author_username`, `slug_url`, `created_date` (Human readable) and `short_snippet`
* `.longSnippet` - this will return the post with an `id`, `title`, `author_name`, `author_username`, `slug_url`, `created_date` (Human readable) and `long_snippet`. It will also include all of the tags in a `tags` object if there are any associated with that post
* `.all` - this returns the post with all information, including both snippet lengths, including author names and human readable dates, as well as both dates in ISO 8601 format under the parameter names `created_date_iso8601` and `last_edited_date_iso8601`.

If no `Context` is supplied to the `makeNode()` call you will get:

* `id`
* `title`
* `contents`
* `bloguser_id` - The ID of the Author of the post
* `created` - The time the post was created as a `Double`
* `slug_url`
* `published` - Whether the post has been published or not

## Blog User

The blog user has a `withPostCount` `BlogUserContext` available to pass into the `makeNode()` function that provides an extra `post_count` parameter to the user node, which contains the number of posts that author has written.

## Blog Tag

The blog user has a `withPostCount` `BlogTagContext` available to pass into the `makeNode()` function that provides an extra `post_count` parameter to the tag node, which contains the number of posts tagged with that tag.

# Snippets

SteamPress supports two type of snippets for blog posts - short and long. Short snippets will provide the first paragraph or so of the blog post, whereas long snippets will show several paragraphs (such as for use on the main blog page, when listing all of the posts)

## Usage

You can pass in a `BlogPostContext` to the `makeNode()` call to provide more information when getting `BlogPost` objects, as shown above.

You can also call them directly on a `BlogPost` object (such as from a `Query()`):

```swift
// These both return the some of the contents of a blog post (as a String)
let shortSnippet = post.shortSnippet()
let longSnippet = post.longSnippet()
```

# Markdown Provider

The Markdown Provider allows you to render markdown as HTML in your Leaf files. To use, just simply use:

```
#markdown(myObject.markdownContent)
```

This will convert the `Node` object `myObject`'s `markdownContent` to HTML (you pass in `myObject` as a parameter to your Leaf view). It uses CommonMark under the hood, but for more details, see the [Markdown Provider repo](https://github.com/vapor-community/markdown-provider).

# API

SteamPress also contains an API for accessing certain things that may be useful. The current endpoints are:

* `/<blog-path>/api/tags/` - returns all the tags that have been saved in JSON

# Roadmap

I anticipate SteamPress staying on a version 0 for some time, whilst some of the biggest features are implemented. Semantic versioning makes life a little difficult for this as any new endpoints will require a breaking change for you to add Leaf templates! However, I will aim to stabilise this as quickly as possible, and any breaking changes will be announced in the [releases](https://github.com/brokenhandsio/SteamPress/releases) page.

On the roadmap we have:

* AMP/Facebook instant articles endpoints for posts
* Saving state when logging in - if you go to a page (e.g. edit post) but need to be logged in, it would be great if you could head back to that page once logged in. Also, if you have edited a post and your session expires before you post it, wouldn't it be great if it remembered everything!
